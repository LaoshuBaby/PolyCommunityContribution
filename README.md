# PolyCommunityContribution

Show all your contributions to notable communities with one place

## Description

This repository is a visualization project which is used to show and render badge for all your contributions you have made.

Many times you have a series account and those communities don't have date exchanged. And the power of human is limited, you someday focus on one site, but other days you change target to another one. So you will harvest 2 day-missing chart, like this:

[假装这儿是一张Github的瓷砖图]

But if added them to one chart, that will let people know how many you have did in those days.

## Support Guideline

1. The Community should be public and visible to the Internet, not in a private website or need to log in to spider information.
2. The Community should allow a newly register user to make sensible changes, review and censore are not have to do. (Validator is allowed, such as Wikipedia)
3. Basic feature are free, and will not be charged in the future

## Won't Support

### 低质量wiki

+ Fans wiki (For example, Minecraft wiki, 萌娘百科)
+ Non-neutral or AD wiki (For example, 百度百科，互动百科)

### 非技术驱动的代码托管平台 / Non-technical driven host platform

（技术不中立（可能受商业干扰或作为开源商业模式宣传的一部分的）的托管平台）

+ CCF Gitlink （确实开源）：https://www.gitlink.org.cn/
+ AtomGit (开放原子基金会）：https://atomgit.com/
+ SaaS代码托管，如[阿里云CodeUp](https://www.aliyun.com/product/yunxiao/codeup)/[腾讯云CODING-CR](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/coding-cr)/[华为云CodeArts Repo（原CodeHub）](https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/codehub.html)，因为它们上的项目通常出于对SaaS平台的宣传任务
