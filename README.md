# PolyCommunityContribution

Show all your contributions to notable communities with one place

----------

This repository is a visualization project which is used to show and render badge for all your contributions you have made.

Many times you have a series account and those communities don't have date exchanged. And the power of human is limited, you someday focus on one site, but other days you change target to another one. So you will harvest 2 day-missing chart, like this:

But if added them to one chart, that will let people know how many you have did in those days.
